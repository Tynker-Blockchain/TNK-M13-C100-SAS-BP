1. Fetch Signed-In User Account Details
* Open the file `app.py`.


* Store the username from the wallet page and pass it to the class initializer.
```
username = myWallet.username
account = Account(username)
```


* Open the file `wallet.py`.


* Add the username to the database by passing the `username` parameter within `def_init_()` and `addToDB()` and adding username to the database.
```
def __init__(self, username):
    self.account = web3.eth.account.create()
    self.address = self.account.address
    self.privateKey = self.account.key.hex()
    self.addToDB(self.address, self.privateKey, username)


def addToDB(self, address, privateKey, username):
    ref = db.reference("accounts/" + address + "/")
    ref.set({
  "address" : address,
  "privateKey" :privateKey,
  "username": username
    })
```


* Store the accounts of the current user in the alphabetical order using the `order_by_child()` and `equal_to()` method.

ref = db.reference('accounts/').order_by_child('username').equal_to(self.username)
```
Note: Create a rule in the Firebase database as below by navigating to Realtime Database -> Rules.
