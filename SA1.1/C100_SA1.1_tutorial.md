Follow the given steps to complete this activity.


1. Save the username when the user signs in
* Open the file `wallet.py`.


* Set the `username` to `None`.
```
self.username = None
```


* Store the user credentials on the Firebase database by defining the `addUser()` method using `db.ref()` and `db_name.set()` methods.
```
def addUser(self, username, password):
    ref = db.reference('users/'+ username + "/")
    ref.set({'username': username, 'password': password})
    self.username = username
    return True
```
* Add the username and password for a user by calling the `addUser()` method and store it in the `isSignedIn` variable within the `SignIn()` function.
```
global myWallet, isSignedIn
isSignedIn = myWallet.addUser(username, password)
```
 
2. Check if the user is signed-in
* Open the file `app.py`.
* Create the `isSignedIn` flag variable that tells if the user is signed in or not and set it to `False` initially.
```
isSignedIn = False
```


* Check if the user is signed in and then retrieve their account information.
```
if(isSignedIn):
    allAccounts = myWallet.getAccounts()
    if(account == None and allAccounts):
        account = allAccounts[0]
    if(account):
        if(type(account) == dict):
            balance = myWallet.getBalance(account['address'])
            transactions = myWallet.getTransactions(account['address'])
    else:
        balance = myWallet.getBalance(account.address)
        transactions = myWallet.getTransactions(account.address)
```
Note: Remember to indent the code.


* Display the balance and transactions of signed in users by passing `isSignedIn` within the `render_template()` method.
```
return render_template('index.html',isSignedIn = isSignedIn)
```
3. Add sign-out functionality
* Sign out the user by defining `isSigned` to global and accessing the `isSignedIn` variable within the signOut() function and set it as False.
`global isSignedIn`
`isSignedIn = False`


* Save and run the code to check the output.
